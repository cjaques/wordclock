# Wordclock
Code for yet another wordclock, that one isn't generic though.
Made as a gift for friends, it holds names and specifics... Anyhow, feel free to contact me in case you'd like to use the code and need help.

## Assembly
You can find the SVG files I designed for the wood and plexiglas parts in the laserCut directory.
Watch out, the dimensions are not set, so you need to set them within the laser-cutter software.

### Parts list
* Arduino Leonardo
* LedStrip : I used [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/0.html?spm=a2g0s.9042647.6.2.WLVHRD&orderId=81806470273053&productId=1592593512)
* Real Time Clock : [Seed Studio RTC](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-RTC/)
* ...

## Dependencies
The Arduino code is self-contained in the code directory.
You just need the Arduino IDE and the Pololuled library.


## Ackowledgment
