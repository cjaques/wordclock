# Wordclock
Code for yet another wordclock, that one isn't generic though.
Made as a gift for friends, it holds names and specifics... Anyhow, feel free to contact me in case you'd like to use the code and need help.

## Assembly
That should come... I'll give the design of the mechanic parts too.
### Parts list
* Arduino Leonardo
* LedStrip --> I used [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/0.html?spm=a2g0s.9042647.6.2.WLVHRD&orderId=81806470273053&productId=1592593512)
* ...

## Dependencies
The code is Arduino-based. 
You just need the Arduino IDE and the Pololuled library.


## Ackowledgment

* The project originated from the [***FabLab*** in Neuchatel](http://fablab-neuch.ch/)
* A big shout out to the creators and maintainers of FluidSynth
